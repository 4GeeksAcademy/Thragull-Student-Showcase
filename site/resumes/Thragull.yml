    # You have 1 paragraph to make a great impression, summarize your career
    summary: |
      I'm not the kind of person that stands in a single place doing nothing. I always have to be doing something. 
      I usually work as a Flight Attendant, travelling all around the Glove, but I also want to do something else in
      my free time, and I realised that programming is something I can do from everywhere.
